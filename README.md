# Younioner
Younioner is **multiple client** reverse shell created by Ayoub Ouakkaha, which is now still under development

### What is a Reverse Shell?
A reverse shell is one by which target machine communicates back to the attacking machine. The attaching machine has a listener port on which it receives the connection by which a code,command or execution is achieved.

## How to use it?
You can clone the git repository from here.
https://github.com/AyoubOuakkaha/Younioner-Python3_Reverse_Shell
And just run the Python executable.
* **Windows/Linux**
Once you have cloned the project,run the server using
`python Server.py` 
And to run the client version,
`python Client.py`

## Make it Executable:
instead of running python client.py every time we want to run the client module you can do this inside **windows** Using Py2Exe Library, after bellow proccess you will have .exe ready to run in anywhere without python, just follow me

1. download and install the library using this link [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/py2exe/files/py2exe/0.6.9/)

2. with in command Prompt and inside the directory which you download the Younioner into run this command:
`python setup.py install`
3. that's it now you will be able to see dist folder just open it and you find **Client.exe** executable(its the one) 

To Do this Linux i only know one library that could get the job done which is **PyInstaller**, you can find more about this process using this link **[pythonhosted's website](https://pythonhosted.org/PyInstaller/)**
